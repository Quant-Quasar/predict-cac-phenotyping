"""Stage 5 cluster tendency check via Hopkins statistic (D021 part 1).

Hopkins (Hopkins 1954, Lawson and Jurs 1990, Banerjee 2004) compares the
nearest-neighbour distance distribution of:
  * real data points (sampled at random from the data, distance to their
    2nd-nearest neighbour, which skips self), denoted ``u_i``
  * synthetic points sampled uniformly inside the data's bounding box,
    distance to their 2nd-nearest neighbour in the data, denoted ``w_i``

Hopkins H = sum(w_i) / (sum(w_i) + sum(u_i))

Both queries use the 2nd-nearest neighbour, matching the pyclustertend
canonical Python convention. This symmetric choice is what makes H ~ 0.5
on uniform random data:
  - real query's 2nd-NN skips self (the 1st-NN at distance 0)
  - uniform query's 2nd-NN skips the "accidentally too close" 1st-NN
The plain-distance formula with this symmetric skip is finite-sample-
stable; the alternative "d-th power" convention from the original Hopkins
paper amplifies finite-sample noise catastrophically in higher dimensions
and is not used in modern implementations.

Interpretation (Banerjee 2004 ranges):
  H near 1.0  -> strong clustering (real points are tightly grouped relative
                 to the bounding box, so uniform samples are far from data)
  H around 0.5 -> random distribution
  H below 0.5  -> regular spacing (anti-clustering)

We adopt thresholds from the D021 config:
  H >= 0.65       -> clustering tendency confirmed
  0.55 <= H < 0.65 -> ambiguous (report both downstream outcomes)
  H < 0.55       -> no cluster tendency

This module is a fast guard. If H is below the ambiguous band the
downstream gap statistic + consensus clustering are still run, but the
expected outcome (k = 1) is documented up front.

Determinism: seeded random sample of m data rows and m uniform points; same
seed plus same data give a byte-identical H.

Decisions referencing this module:
    D021 - Hopkins threshold 0.65, ambiguous band 0.55 to 0.65, sample 10%.
