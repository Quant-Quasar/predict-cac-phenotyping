"""Build a separate 3D binary mask per canonical vessel (D008).

For each vessel in ``LAD``, ``RCA``, ``LCx``, ``LM``, call the same
``mask_builder.build_3d_mask`` used for the whole-mask in stage 2, with a
``vessel_filter`` that restricts rasterisation to that vessel. The same
``excluded_roi_ids`` is applied — per-vessel masks are voxel-consistent with
the whole-mask: summing the four per-vessel voxel counts equals the whole-
mask voxel count (modulo zero overlap, which is guaranteed by the disjoint
vessel labels).

This is the input layer for per-vessel PyRadiomics and per-vessel
shape/intensity features. The XML-derived per-vessel scalars (volume, mass,
mean/max HU, Agatston, density tiers) come from the dedicated modules and
do not need a mask.

Decisions referencing this module:
    D008 — Per-artery masks via filter-then-rasterise.
    D012 — excluded_roi_ids consistency with whole-mask.
