# D014 Perturbation set (14 perturbations)

**Date**: 2026-06-03
**Stage**: stability
**Status**: Active
**Module**: `src/predict/stability/perturbations.py`, `scripts/04_perturbations.py`

## Decision

Apply **14 deterministic perturbations** to each patient's CT volume. The mask is held fixed; only the CT array is transformed. Each (patient, perturbation) pair re-extracts the empirical-track features and contributes one column to the 422-by-14 reliability matrix consumed by D013.

### Implementation rules

- **Rotation**: SimpleITK `Euler3DTransform` about the volume centre, linear interpolation, constant background fill = -1024 (air HU). Z axis only; no x/y rotations because the cohort is axial-gated and clinically plausible mis-registration is in-plane.
- **Translation**: SimpleITK `TranslationTransform`, linear interpolation, constant fill = -1024. Translation is in physical millimetres, converted to voxel offsets per patient's resampled spacing (0.5 x 0.5 x 3.0 mm per D005). z is not translated; slice spacing of 3 mm makes sub-slice z shifts ambiguous and gated cardiac acquisition limits z mis-registration in real workflows.
- **Noise**: independent Gaussian added pixel-wise with deterministic seed `seed = int(pid) * 1_000 + sigma_int` for reproducibility across reruns. Clipped to the same `[-200, 3000]` HU range as the source preprocessed array.
- **Mask is not transformed**. This is the test-retest reproducibility convention (Mackin 2015, Lin 2022 for cardiac calcium), not the IBSI-2 convention. The two designs answer different questions: co-perturbing the mask tests whether the extractor is numerically equivariant under rigid transforms (a software correctness check); holding the mask fixed tests whether features survive small mis-registrations of the CT relative to a fixed reference segmentation (the clinically relevant question for test-retest stability in downstream phenotype discovery). Our pipeline is downstream-driven, so we adopt the fixed-mask design. v1 co-perturbed the mask, which is a weaker test for our use case (most rigid-transform perturbations become near-identity and ICC is dominated by noise).
- **Order is fixed**: perturbations are indexed 0 through 13 in the table above so that the 422-by-14 reliability matrix is reproducible across reruns.

## Rationale

- **Why these magnitudes**: ±5 to ±10 degrees of rotation, ±2 to ±5 mm of translation, and 5 to 10 HU of additive noise span the clinically plausible registration-error envelope for gated cardiac CT. Larger values would test the radiomics pipeline outside its intended operating range. Smaller values produce uniformly high ICC and would not discriminate. v1 D023 used the same envelope.
- **Why 14 perturbations**: enough degrees of freedom for stable ICC estimation per Bonett 2002 (n_subjects >> n_raters, n_raters >= 6 is sufficient). 14 also matches v1 for cross-version comparability.
- **Z-axis rotation only**: cardiac NCCT is gated axially; left-right and head-foot tilts that produce out-of-axial rotations are extremely uncommon in clinical reality and would primarily test the resampling code, not biological feature stability.
- **No z translation**: slice spacing is 3 mm. A sub-slice z shift is either (a) negligible after re-resampling or (b) loses an entire slice's worth of calcium for the +/-2 mm probe. Neither outcome teaches us about feature stability; it teaches us about interpolator choice. We exclude it.
- **Deterministic noise seed per (pid, sigma)**: the same patient produces the same noisy array on a rerun. This is necessary for D013's ICC to be a fixed property of the feature set, not a function of RNG state.

## Alternatives considered

- **More rotations including ±1, ±2 degrees**: too small to move features off their precision floor; adds compute, no information.
- **More noise levels (sigma=2, 20)**: sigma=2 is below the residual noise of the source acquisition (CTDIvol heterogeneity in our cohort already implies ~5 HU baseline noise per the dataset report). sigma=20 is above clinically plausible regimes and would distort HU thresholding.
- **Random rather than deterministic perturbation parameters**: ICC computed on random draws estimates a population mean ICC, which sounds more general but is not what downstream code consumes. We need ICC of a fixed feature pipeline, so the design matrix is fixed.
- **Geometric mask perturbations** (erosion / dilation by 1 voxel): tests segmentation robustness, not registration. Out of scope for this stage; can be added as a stage 7 sensitivity probe.

## Verified by

- `tests/stability/test_perturbations.py`: each transform produces a CT of the same shape; noise has the expected std on a constant image; rotation by 360 degrees is near-identity (interpolation round-trip); translation by 0 is identity.
- `scripts/04_perturbations.py`: writes 14 per-patient extraction logs, one per perturbation, with a manifest mapping `(pid, pert_id)` to the saved feature row.
