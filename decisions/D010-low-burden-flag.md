# D010 — `low_burden_flag` for very-small-mask patients

**Date**: 2026-06-02
**Stage**: features
**Status**: Active
**Module**: `scripts/03_features.py`

## Decision

Add a boolean column `low_burden_flag` to `outputs/03_features/features.csv`:

```
low_burden_flag = (mask_voxels < 100)
```

`mask_voxels` is the patient's whole-mask voxel count from stage 2 (`outputs/02_preprocessed/preprocess_report.csv`). The threshold (100 voxels) is from config: `features.low_burden_voxel_threshold`.

**No feature is dropped or set to NaN at extraction time** based on this flag. Every patient gets a full feature row. The flag is metadata for downstream filtering.

## Rationale

PyRadiomics' `minimumROISize=14` already prevents extraction on the tiniest masks. But masks in the 14–100 voxel range pass that gate and produce numerically defined texture features whose biological meaning is questionable — too few unique gray levels after binning, degenerate co-occurrence matrices.

Two design options were considered:

1. **Gate at extraction time** (NaN texture for low-burden patients) — produces patient-specific NaN patterns that complicate downstream PCA / clustering / ICC. Loses data when it's not strictly needed.
2. **Track but don't filter** (D010) — every patient gets a complete row; downstream code that wants to exclude low-burden patients filters on one column. Reduce/analyse stages run a planned "sensitivity-exclusion" rerun (re-run phenotype discovery excluding `low_burden_flag == True`, confirm clusters are stable) as a published robustness check.

Option 2 is more robust:
- Avoids NaN-induced PCA degeneracy.
- Avoids losing data unnecessarily — many features (Agatston, lesion count, per-artery aggregates) are voxel-count-independent and remain valid at any burden.
- The ICC perturbation gate in stage 4 separately handles cohort-wide feature reliability — texture features that are systematically unstable on small masks fail ICC and get dropped from the analysis set anyway.

## Alternatives considered

- **Gate at extraction time (set texture columns to NaN)** — rejected for the reasons above.
- **Drop low-burden patients entirely from analysis** — loses data; low-burden patients are still part of the cohort and Agatston / spatial features for them are valid.
- **Higher threshold (e.g., 200, 500)** — too aggressive; would flag many legitimate low-burden patients whose first-order and shape features are fine. 100 is the IBSI-suggested "should be reliable" floor for full texture; below it, texture is suspect.

## Graceful degrade for masks below PyRadiomics' minimumROISize

A subset of `low_burden_flag == True` patients have masks below the IBSI floor
(`minimumROISize = 14` per D009). PyRadiomics refuses to extract on these and
raises `ValueError: Size of the ROI is too small`.

The orchestration script catches this exception, sets:

  - `radiomics_status = "skipped"`,
  - `radiomics_reason = "<PyRadiomics error message>"`,

and writes the row anyway with the XML-derived features (Agatston, spatial,
density tiers, per-vessel aggregates) intact. The PyRadiomics columns are
absent for that row and become `NaN` in `features.csv` once pandas pads the
schema.

Empirical result on the 444-patient cohort: 22 patients skip PyRadiomics
(masks 6–14 voxels), 422 get a complete row. All 22 are also flagged with
`low_burden_flag = True`.

Rationale for this design: dropping those 22 patients would lose perfectly
valid XML-derived features for the lowest-burden segment of the cohort.
Lowering `minimumROISize` would compute texture on noise. Keeping the rows
with NaN'd PyRadiomics is the only option that preserves data without
silently introducing meaningless texture values.

## Verified by

- `scripts/03_features.py` writes the column for every patient.
- Full-cohort run: 444 rows in `features.csv`, 22 with NaN PyRadiomics
  columns and `radiomics_status="skipped"`.
- Reduce stage carries the flag through and runs the sensitivity-exclusion
  analysis (logged in stage 5 doc).
